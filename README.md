# GeanyLua Scripts

This repository contains some [GeanyLua](https://plugins.geany.org/geanylua/) scripts:

* toggle-menu: Hide the menubar.  For those who like minimal interfaces.

* column-markers: Show long-line markers at multiple columns, in different colors. 

## Usage

* Please read the [GeanyLua Introduction](https://plugins.geany.org/geanylua/geanylua-intro.html) for general installation and usage instructions.

* Scripts are in their own folders for organization, but they were written to be placed directly in the GeanyLua config folder.  On Linux, the folder is located at `~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/`

* You may need to create additional folders, like `~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/events/`

* When new scripts are added, Geany may need to be restarted.

* When old scripts are modified, Geany *usually* does not need to be restarted.
